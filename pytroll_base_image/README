This example shows how to:

- Build a Docker base image that is used as basis for all other images
  described in this repository

1) Building the Docker image

a) Install Docker

  Install docker following the instructions from the following links for
  your operating system.

  Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
  Fedora: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/
  OSX: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/
  Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

b) Build the "pytroll_base_image"

  There are two options for the base image:

    - Red Hat Enterprise Linux Universal Base Image (`Dockerfile_rhel_ubi`)
    - Ubuntu base image (`Dockerfile_ubuntu`)

  The choice between these two depends on the policy at the institute.
  If there's no such restrictions, it doesn't matter which one is
  used.

  To build the image, issue the command

    docker build -t pytroll_base_image -f build_dir/Dockerfile_ubuntu build_dir

  or

    docker build -t pytroll_base_image -f build_dir/Dockerfile_rhel_ubi build_dir

c) Confirm the build succeeded

  The image "pytroll_base_image" should now be in the output of

    docker images

  and the command

    docker run -it pytroll_base_image echo "success"

  should print "success" to the terminal.
