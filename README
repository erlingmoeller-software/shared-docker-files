This repository has recipes to build Docker images for running
satellite image processing.  The recipes are mainly concentrated on
using Pytroll packages.

To start, see the README file in pytroll_base_image directory, then
move on to other directories as required by the use case.

Currently available images:

  pytroll_base_image

    - the base image used for all the other images.  Includes only the
      operating system (Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu as
      options) and the base installation of Mambaforge

  trollmoves

    - contains Trollmoves Server and Client for transferring data

  trollflow2_full_image

    - contains pretty much everything needed to run Trollflow2 to
      process images using Satpy, resample them with Pyresample, and
      so on.

Each of the actual runnable container images have example
configuration files that can be used as starting points.
