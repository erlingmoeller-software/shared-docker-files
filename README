This repository has recipes to build Docker images for running
satellite image processing.  The recipes are mainly concentrated on
using Pytroll packages.

To start, see the README file in pytroll_base_image directory, then
move on to other directories as required by the use case.

Each of the actual runnable container images have example
configuration files that can be used as starting points.
